<h3> Congratulations to Dr. Enrique Hern√°ndez Lemus, for being awarded the Marcos Moshinsky Cathedra on the field of physics!
<p><br>
<h5>


The Marcos Moshinsky Cathedra is a yearly award given to Mexican scientists in physics, mathematics, and biochemistry,
for developing a research project in their fields of interest. The winners are rigorously selected by renowned Mexican scientists.
<p>
The cathedras of research are a permanent homage to the scientific labor of Marcos Moshinsky and a lifetime honor for the
 awardees. It is expected that, over the years, the awardees form a big family with a common goal: promoting scientific research in Mexico.
