During his doctorate, Professor Hernández-Lemus worked in theoretical chemical
physics and non-equilibrium statistical physics. In particular, he developed an
irreversible thermodynamics formalism to study molecular systems in the critical
point far from equilibrium. In the context of this formalism, by extending ideas
from measure theory and mathematical statistical mechanics, he was able to derive
correlation functions for non-equilibrium systems without using equilibrium
closures (such as the Ornstein-Zernike). This work was the first fully-analytical
study, free from adjustable parameters, to describe appropriately (both
quantitatively and qualitatively) the critical co-solution transition for a
binary mixture with its associated transport processes [Hernández-Lemus, E.
García-Colín, L.S., Non-equilibrium critical behavior: An extended irreversible
thermodynamics approach, Jou. of Non-Equil. Thermodyn., 31, 4, 397-417, (2006)].<p>

<br>
Within biological physics and computational systems biology, current research
includes the development of a non-equilibrium thermodynamics theoretical framework
to study whole genome transcriptional regulation in eukaryotes (humans in
particular) [Hernández-Lemus, E., Non-Equilibrium Thermodynamics of Gene Expression
and Transcriptional Regulation, Jou. of Non-Equil. Thermodyn., 34, 4, 371-394, (2009)].<p>

<br>
This theoretical framework has been used to analyze transcriptional bursts and
their relation with anomalous gene expression in cancer [Hernández-Lemus, E.,
Correa-Rodríguez, M.D., Non-equilibrium hyperbolic transport in transcriptional
regulation, PLoS ONE 6, 7, e21558 (2011)] and their role in specific genes at the
coupling between metabolic disruption and cancer [Baca-López, K., Hidalgo-Miranda,
A., Mayorga, M., Gutiérrez-Nájera, N.,Hernández-Lemus, E., The role of master
regulators in the metabolic/ transcriptional coupling in breast carcinomas, PLoS
ONE 7, 8, e42678, (2012)].<p>

<br>
Aside from individual developments, Professor Hernández-Lemus has been also
involved in the statistical and computational design of high-end experimental
projects such as the Mexican Genome Project (Mexican Genome Diversity and Genomic
Medicine Project) [Silva-Zolezzi I, et al., Analysis of genomic diversity in
Mexican Mestizo populations to develop genomic medicine in Mexico. PNAS 106, 21,
8611- 8616, (2009)] and the sequencing of the genome of diffuse large B-cell
lymphoma cells [Lohr, J., et al., Discovery and Prioritization of Somatic
Mutations in DLBCL by Whole Exome Sequencing, PNAS 109, 10, 3879-3884, (2012)].<p>

<br>
Dr. Hernández- Lemus is also a strong advocate for OpenScience/OpenAccess [He
is Academic Editor at PLoS ONE and Review Editor at Frontiers in Physiology] and
has devoted special efforts to spread the role of theoretical physics (specially
statistical mechanics and complex systems) in the biomedical research community
within his country.<p>
